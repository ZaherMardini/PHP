REGEX cheat sheet (use regex101 website)
--> The main function to deal with regex are preg_match() & preg_match_all
--> "|" the pipe in regex is like the "or" statement, ex /d|b|v/ => match d or b or v
--> "[bxcv] === b|x|c|v" when typing random patterns in the square brackets it's like using the pipe operator
--> "[]" square brackets are used to specify the range, ex: /[r-z]/ => match all characters from r to z
--> "[^]" caret operator match everything except ..., ex /[^s]/ => match everything except s

========>Meta charachers<======== written OUTSIDE the square brackets
--> "\w"   word character, shorthand for [a-zA-Z0-9_] notice the underscore
--> "\W"   non-word character, the opposite of "\w", matches spaces dash special characters question mark etc...
--> "\d"   digit character, shorthand for [0-9]
--> "\D"   non-digit character, shorthand for [^0-9]
--> "\s"   white space character, matches spaces, tabs, newline characters
--> "\S"   non-white space character
--> "."    matches any character except for newline terminators, ex: /en../ matches the word starting with en and three charachers after it 
           note that the pattern /\./ will match the dot only
--> "^"    caret characher indicates that the following pattern should be at the beginning of the string or the line
--> "$"    caret characher indicates that the PRECEDING - ex: /pattern$/ - pattern should be at the end of the string or the line
--> "*"    match zero or more occurences of the character ex:  /k*/ matches "" "k" "kk" "kkk" ...
--> "+"    match one or more occurences of the character ex:  /k+/ matches "k" "kk" "kkk" ...
--> "?"    match zero or one occurence of the character ex:  /k?/ matches "" "k"
--> "{n}"  match n occurrences of the preceding character ex: /k{3}/ matches "kkk"
--> "{n,}"  match n or more occurrences of the preceding character ex: /k{3,}/ matches "kkk" "kkkk" ....
--> "{n,m}"  match interval from n to m occurrences of the preceding character ex: /k{2,4}/ matches "kk" "kkk" "kkkk"

Uploading images into database & viewing them: !best practice!
1-Each server has two sections 
    1-one to store structured data (the DB that we query on)
    2-a file system to store the actual files (imgs, videos, etc...)
2-Storing images has two main steps : 
    1- storing the image metadata(name, path on the server, size, tmp name) on the DB => insert query
    2- storing the actual image on the server's file system => move_uploaded_file(TMP_file name (if not tmp it won't work), upload path on the server);
3-To view the imgs => <img src="the fetched path from DB">

++++++++++Note #6++++++++++
If you get wrning when using session_start()
go to php.ini and change this => session.save_path = "C:/xampp/tmp" to session.save_path = "G:/xampp/tmp"
"type whatever directory of the tmp file in xampp"

The optimal fetching flow 
 1- Make connection connection string ex: $dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=crud_ops";
 2- $record = $connection->prepare($query); //placeholder paraameter should start with {:}
 3- $record = $record->execute(); // to check 
 4- after checking => $record->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
